## API Access Token

When you sign up for an account, you are given an API Access Token. This token is used to authenticate your requests to the API. You can find your API Access Token in the [Account Settings](/account/settings) page.

### Permissions

The API Access Token is associated with a user and has the same permissions as that user. For example, if the user is an admin, the API Access Token will have admin permissions. If the user is a member, the API Access Token will have member permissions.
